      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Shiwani Golani, a passionate web developer and current Computer Science student. I specialize in creating dynamic and beautiful web pages. I have completed an internship at CodeSoft and am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In addition to my academic studies, I've participated in sessions related to scholarships and completed a comprehensive web development bootcamp. I believe in the power of clean code and the importance of user-friendly interfaces.

        I started my journey in web development with a keen interest in crafting engaging, intuitive, and functional web applications. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development.
